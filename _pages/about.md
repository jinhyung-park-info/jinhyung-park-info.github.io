About Me
------
Starting December 29th, 2021, I will be working as a software developer at [NAVER](https://www.navercorp.com/en). I recently graduated from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/) (Seoul, Korea) where I received a dual degree of B.S.E in Computer Science and Engineering and B.S.E. in Urban Planning and Engineering with the highest distinction, and worked as a research intern at the [Computer Graphics and Applications Lab](http://cga.yonsei.ac.kr/), advised by Professor In-Kwon Lee. My undergraduate studies was fully funded from the [National Scholarship for Science and Engineering](https://www.kosaf.go.kr/eng/jsp/aid/aid02_01_01.jsp), a merit-based national scholarship awarded to science & engineering students with top 3% admission score.

My primary research interest lies at the intersection of computer graphics and computer vision, including subjects, but not limited to physics-based simulation, computer animation, robotics, and computational photography. My ultimate goal is to develop frameworks that can help us simulate, recreate, and manipulate the physical, visual world around us.

**Ongoing**<br/>
Currently, I am enrolled in the _NC Fellowship - Neural Graphics Track_ program, an AI-talent development program hosted and sponsored by [NCSOFT](https://kr.ncsoft.com/en/index.do). Along with specialized training sessions in computer graphics, I am currently developing a system that denoises motion capture data to generate realistic 3D character animation for game character development. <br/>
